# Lab 1: Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Python Basics
**Experiment 1.1: Set Theory Basics in Python.py** 

**Aim**

To understand and implement the representation of sets and basic set operations in Python.

**Background/Theory**

A set is an unordered collection of items. In mathematics, a set can be defined as a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Python provides a datatype called `set` that allows for set creation and the performance of basic set operations.


**Procedure**

**1. Creating Sets:** Initialize a set using Python's built-in ‘set’ data type.

**2. Perform Union:** Use the ‘union’ function or ‘|’ operator.

**3. Perform Intersection:** Use the ‘intersection’ ‘function or ‘&’ operator.

**4. Perform Difference:** Use the ‘difference’ function or ‘-‘ operator.

**5. Perform Symmetric Difference:** Use the ‘symmetric_difference’ function or ‘^’ operator.

**6. Subset and Superset Checks:** Use the ‘issubset’ and ‘issuperset’ methods.



**Observations**
Document your observations after executing the Python code. Notice the results of each set operation and how they compare with mathematical set operations.



**Exercises 1.1: YOUR TURN**

1. Create two sets with your choice of elements and find their union.
   
3. For the above sets, determine their intersection.
   
5. Using a set of numbers from 1 to 10 and another set of numbers from 5 to 15, determine the symmetric difference.
   
7. Check if the set `{1, 2, 3}` is a subset of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

 ## Experiment 1.2: Python Basics for Mathematical Computation
 

**Aim**

To familiarize oneself with basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions in Python.


**Background/Theory**

Python offers a robust platform for mathematical computations. The base language provides a range of arithmetic operations, and the `math` module extends these capabilities to offer functions like square root, factorial, logarithm, etc.

 

**Procedure**

**1. Basic Arithmetic:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**2. Power and Modulus:** Use `**` for power and `%` for modulus operations.

**3. Square Root:** Use ‘math.sqrt()’.

**4. Factorial:** Compute the factorial of a number using ‘math.factorial()’.

**5. Logarithm:** Compute logarithm values using ‘math.log()’.

**6. Trigonometry:** Compute sine, cosine, and tangent values using ‘math.sin()’, ‘math.cos()’, and ‘math.tan()’.



**Observations**

Document your observations regarding the arithmetic and mathematical functions executed in Python. Observe how certain operations might differ from typical calculator results due to floating-point precision.


 

**Exercises 1.2: YOUR TURN**

1. Compute and print the factorial of 7.

2. Determine the square root of 144.

3. Calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 30 degrees.

4. Compute the natural logarithm of 50.
